# HadFun - Legal Documents

## Option 1: Keep Current Basic Terms (Not Recommended for Social Features)

Your current terms cover:
- Age requirements (18+)
- Prediction deadlines
- Payment processing via Stripe
- Privacy basics

**Problem:** These are too basic for a social platform with:
- User-generated content (posts, comments, stories)
- Charity features and donations
- Community interactions
- Photo/video uploads (planned)

---

## Option 2: Comprehensive Terms of Service (Recommended)

I've prepared full legal documents below that you can implement.

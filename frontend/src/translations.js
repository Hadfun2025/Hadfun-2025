        "Even during the First World War, on Christmas Day 1914, English and German soldiers famously laid down their weapons and came together in no man's land to play football. For that brief, extraordinary moment, enemies became teammates. Humanity triumphed over conflict — proving that the power of sport can transcend even the darkest times.",

Whether it's friendly competitions between mates or global team tournaments, each game has the power to raise awareness and funds for causes that truly matter:",
        "At HadFun, we encourage users to play with purpose — raising funds for the charities that mean the most to them. But we also recognise that charity begins at home. So it's equally fine for teams to play for one another, and if they choose to play with stakes, they can keep the winnings amongst themselves — or share them with a charity of their choice.",

        "HadFun is about rediscovering what sport is really for — bringing people together, breaking down barriers, and making every game count for something bigger than football.",

Durante ese breve y extraordinario momento, los enemigos se convirtieron en compañeros de equipo. La humanidad triunfó sobre el conflicto, demostrando que el poder del deporte puede trascender incluso los momentos más oscuros.",

        "A través de HadFun, jugadores y aficionados de todo el mundo pueden conectarse, competir y contribuir, convirtiendo cada partido, cada predicción y cada desafío en una oportunidad para hacer el bien. Ya se trate de competiciones amistosas entre amigos o de torneos mundiales por equipos, cada partido tiene el poder de crear conciencia y recaudar fondos para causas que realmente importan:",
        "En HadFun, animamos a los usuarios a jugar con un propósito: recaudar fondos para las organizaciones benéficas que más les importan. Pero también reconocemos que la caridad empieza en casa. Por lo tanto, está igualmente bien que los equipos jueguen entre ellos, y si deciden jugar con apuestas, pueden quedarse con las ganancias entre ellos o compartirlas con la organización benéfica que elijan.",

        "Fußball war schon immer mehr als nur ein Spiel – er ist eine universelle Sprache, die Menschen über Grenzen, Kulturen und Generationen hinweg verbindet.",
        "Selbst während des Ersten Weltkriegs, am Weihnachtstag 1914, legten englische und deutsche Soldaten ihre Waffen nieder und kamen im Niemandsland zusammen, um Fußball zu spielen. Für diesen kurzen, außergewöhnlichen Moment wurden Feinde zu Teamkollegen. Die Menschlichkeit triumphierte über den Konflikt – und bewies, dass die Kraft des Sports selbst die dunkelsten Zeiten überwinden kann.",
        "Diese Geschichte hat mich schon immer inspiriert. Sie erinnert daran, dass es beim Fußball nicht nur um Wettbewerb geht – es geht auch um Verbundenheit, Mitgefühl und Gemeinschaft.",
        "HadFun entstand aus der Überzeugung heraus, dass dieser schöne Sport mehr kann als nur unterhalten – er kann etwas bewegen.",
        "Durch HadFun können Spieler und Fans aus aller Welt miteinander in Kontakt treten, gegeneinander antreten und einen Beitrag leisten – so wird jedes Spiel, jede Vorhersage und jede Herausforderung zu einer Gelegenheit, Gutes zu tun. Ob es sich um freundschaftliche Wettkämpfe zwischen Freunden oder um globale Mannschaftsturniere handelt, jedes Spiel hat das Potenzial, das Bewusstsein für wichtige Anliegen zu schärfen und Spenden dafür zu sammeln:",
        "Bei HadFun ermutigen wir Nutzer, mit einem Ziel zu spielen – Spenden für die Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen zu sammeln, die ihnen am wichtigsten sind. Wir sind uns aber auch bewusst, dass Wohltätigkeit zu Hause beginnt. Daher ist es ebenso in Ordnung, wenn Teams gegeneinander spielen, und wenn sie sich dafür entscheiden, um Einsätze zu spielen, können sie die Gewinne unter sich aufteilen – oder sie mit einer Wohltätigkeitsorganisation ihrer Wahl teilen.",
        "Um mit gutem Beispiel voranzugehen, spendet die Verwaltung von HadFun jedes Jahr ihren gesamten Gewinn für wohltätige Zwecke, um sicherzustellen, dass der Geist des Gebens jeden Teil unserer Arbeit durchdringt.",
        "Bei HadFun geht es darum, wiederzuentdecken, wofür Sport wirklich da ist – Menschen zusammenzubringen, Barrieren abzubauen und jedes Spiel zu etwas zu machen, das über den Fußball hinausgeht.",
        "Also, spielt zum Spaß. Spielt mit einem Ziel. Lasst uns HadFun spielen – wo jedes Tor dazu beiträgt, die Welt zu verändern."

        "Même pendant la Première Guerre mondiale, le jour de Noël 1914, des soldats anglais et allemands ont déposé leurs armes et se sont retrouvés dans le no man's land pour jouer au football. Pendant ce bref moment extraordinaire, les ennemis sont devenus coéquipiers. L'humanité a triomphé du conflit, prouvant que le pouvoir du sport peut transcender même les moments les plus sombres.",
        "Cette histoire m'a toujours inspiré. Elle nous rappelle que le football n'est pas seulement une compétition, mais aussi un moyen de créer des liens, de faire preuve de compassion et de renforcer la communauté.",
        "HadFun est né de cette conviction : ce beau sport peut faire plus que divertir, il peut changer les choses.",
        "Grâce à HadFun, les joueurs et les fans du monde entier peuvent se connecter, s'affronter et contribuer, transformant chaque match, chaque pronostic et chaque défi en une occasion de faire le bien. Qu'il s'agisse de compétitions amicales entre amis ou de tournois mondiaux par équipes, chaque match a le pouvoir de sensibiliser et de collecter des fonds pour des causes qui comptent vraiment :",
        "Chez HadFun, nous encourageons les utilisateurs à jouer dans un but précis : collecter des fonds pour les associations caritatives qui leur tiennent le plus à cœur. Mais nous reconnaissons également que la charité commence chez soi. Il est donc tout à fait acceptable que les équipes jouent les unes pour les autres, et si elles choisissent de jouer avec des enjeux, elles peuvent garder les gains entre elles ou les partager avec l'association caritative de leur choix.",
        "Pour montrer l'exemple, l'administration de HadFun reversera chaque année tous ses bénéfices à des associations caritatives, afin que l'esprit de générosité imprègne toutes nos actions.",
        "HadFun vise à redécouvrir la véritable raison d'être du sport : rassembler les gens, briser les barrières et faire en sorte que chaque match ait une importance qui dépasse le cadre du football.",

        "Persino durante la Prima guerra mondiale, il giorno di Natale del 1914, i soldati inglesi e tedeschi posarono le armi e si riunirono nella terra di nessuno per giocare a calcio. In quel breve, straordinario momento, i nemici divennero compagni di squadra. L'umanità trionfò sul conflitto, dimostrando che il potere dello sport può trascendere anche i momenti più bui.",
        "Questa storia mi ha sempre ispirato. Mi ricorda che il calcio non è solo competizione, ma anche connessione, compassione e comunità.",
        "HadFun è nato da questa convinzione: il calcio può fare molto di più che intrattenere, può fare la differenza.",
        "Attraverso HadFun, giocatori e tifosi di tutto il mondo possono connettersi, competere e contribuire, trasformando ogni partita, ogni pronostico e ogni sfida in un'opportunità per fare del bene. Che si tratti di competizioni amichevoli tra amici o di tornei globali tra squadre, ogni partita ha il potere di sensibilizzare l'opinione pubblica e raccogliere fondi per cause che contano davvero:",
        "Noi di HadFun incoraggiamo gli utenti a giocare con uno scopo: raccogliere fondi per le organizzazioni benefiche che stanno loro più a cuore. Ma riconosciamo anche che la beneficenza inizia a casa propria. Quindi va bene anche che le squadre giochino l'una per l'altra e, se decidono di giocare con delle puntate, possono tenere le vincite tra di loro o condividerle con un ente di beneficenza di loro scelta.",
        "Per dare l'esempio, l'amministrazione di HadFun donerà ogni anno tutti i suoi profitti in beneficenza, assicurando che lo spirito di generosità permei ogni aspetto del nostro lavoro.",

        "Voetbal is altijd meer geweest dan alleen een spel — het is een universele taal die mensen over grenzen, culturen en generaties heen verenigt.",
        "Zelfs tijdens de Eerste Wereldoorlog, op eerste kerstdag 1914, legden Engelse en Duitse soldaten hun wapens neer en kwamen ze samen in niemandsland om te voetballen. Gedurende dat korte, buitengewone moment werden vijanden teamgenoten. De menselijkheid zegevierde over het conflict — wat bewijst dat de kracht van sport zelfs de donkerste tijden kan overstijgen.",
        "Dat verhaal heeft me altijd geïnspireerd. Het herinnert me eraan dat voetbal niet alleen om competitie draait, maar ook om verbondenheid, medeleven en gemeenschap.",
        "HadFun is ontstaan vanuit die overtuiging: dat het mooie spel meer kan doen dan alleen entertainen, het kan ook een verschil maken.",
        "Via HadFun kunnen spelers en fans van over de hele wereld contact maken, competitie aangaan en een bijdrage leveren, waardoor elke wedstrijd, elke voorspelling en elke uitdaging een kans wordt om iets goeds te doen. Of het nu gaat om vriendschappelijke wedstrijden tussen vrienden of wereldwijde teamtoernooien, elke wedstrijd heeft de kracht om bewustzijn te creëren en geld in te zamelen voor doelen die er echt toe doen:",
        "Bij HadFun moedigen we gebruikers aan om met een doel te spelen: geld inzamelen voor de goede doelen die voor hen het belangrijkst zijn. Maar we erkennen ook dat liefdadigheid thuis begint. Het is dus net zo goed mogelijk dat teams voor elkaar spelen, en als ze ervoor kiezen om met inzet te spelen, kunnen ze de winst onderling verdelen — of delen met een goed doel naar keuze.",
        "Om het goede voorbeeld te geven, zal het bestuur van HadFun elk jaar alle winst aan een goed doel schenken, zodat de geest van geven in alles wat we doen terugkomt.",
        "HadFun gaat over het herontdekken waar sport echt voor bedoeld is: mensen samenbrengen, barrières doorbreken en elke wedstrijd laten tellen voor iets dat groter is dan voetbal.",

        "Através do HadFun, jogadores e fãs de todo o mundo podem se conectar, competir e contribuir — transformando cada partida, cada previsão e cada desafio em uma oportunidade de fazer o bem. Seja em competições amigáveis entre amigos ou em torneios globais entre equipes, cada jogo tem o poder de aumentar a conscientização e arrecadar fundos para causas que realmente importam:",
        "No HadFun, incentivamos os usuários a jogar com um propósito — arrecadar fundos para as instituições de caridade que mais significam para eles. Mas também reconhecemos que a caridade começa em casa. Portanto, é igualmente válido que as equipes joguem umas pelas outras e, se decidirem jogar com apostas, elas podem ficar com os ganhos entre si — ou compartilhá-los com uma instituição de caridade de sua escolha.",
        "Para dar o exemplo, a administração da HadFun doará todos os seus lucros para instituições de caridade todos os anos, garantindo que o espírito de doação esteja presente em tudo o que fazemos.",
        "A HadFun tem como objetivo redescobrir o verdadeiro propósito do esporte — unir as pessoas, quebrar barreiras e fazer com que cada jogo tenha um significado maior do que o futebol.",
        "Então, jogue por diversão. Jogue com um propósito. Vamos HadFun — Onde cada gol ajuda a mudar o mundo."

# Weekly Pot System - Complete Guide

## 🎮 Two Play Modes

Your predictions platform now supports **TWO modes**:

### 1. **Play for Fun Mode** (Default)
- **No money involved**
- Perfect for casual play
- Compete for bragging rights only
- Track points and weekly winners
- No payment required

### 2. **Weekly Pot Mode** (Optional)
- **Real money weekly pot**
- Team decides stake: £2, £3, or £5 per week
- Winner takes pot (or donates to charity)
- 10% admin fee goes to app creator
- Ties = points only, pot rolls over

---

## 🏆 How It Works

### Weekly Cycle
- **Monday to Sunday** = Competition week
- **Cut-off: Wednesday** (or day before fixtures start)
- Predictions must be in before cut-off
- Winners announced after weekend matches

### Scoring
- **Winner** = Most correct predictions that week
- **Tie** = Multiple people with same top score

### Payouts (Pot Mode Only)
- **Single Winner**: Gets entire pot (minus 10% admin fee)
- **Tie**: Each tied player gets +1 point, pot rolls over to next week
- **10% Admin Fee**: Always goes to app creator (covers hosting + profit)

## 💰 Weekly Pot Example

**Scenario: 10 players, £5 stake**

```
Total collected: 10 × £5 = £50
Admin fee (10%): £5
Distributable pot: £45

If single winner: £45 to winner
If tie (2 players): Pot rolls over + tied players get 1 point each
```

**Next week with rollover:**
```
Previous rollover: £45
New week (10 × £5): £50
Admin fee (10% of £50): £5
New distributable: £45 + £45 = £90
```

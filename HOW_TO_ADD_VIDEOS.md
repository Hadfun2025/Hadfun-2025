# How to Add Videos to HadFun Posts

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST click the "Add" button!

### 🎯 CORRECT WORKFLOW:

```
Step 1: Write your post text
        ↓
Step 2: Scroll to "Add Videos" section
        ↓
Step 3: Paste video URL in the input box
        ↓
Step 4: ⭐ CLICK THE "Add" BUTTON ⭐ (Don't skip this!)
        ↓
Step 5: You'll see a badge appear: "Video 1"
        ↓
Step 6: Now click "Share Post"
        ↓
Step 7: ✅ Video appears in your post!
```

---

## ❌ WHAT YOU'RE DOING (Incorrect):

```
❌ Paste URL → Share Post (video not added!)
```

**Why it doesn't work:**
- Pasting URL alone doesn't save it
- You MUST click "Add" button
- Without clicking "Add", the video stays in the input box
- When you share, videos array is empty: []

---

## ✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD DO (Correct):

```
✅ Paste URL → Click "Add" → See badge → Share Post
```

**What happens:**
- URL goes from input box → videos array
- Badge appears showing "Video 1"
- When you share, video is included
- Video appears in the feed!

## 🎬 VISUAL GUIDE:

### Where is the "Add" button?

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Add Videos (Optional)                     │
│                                            │
│  Video 1  ✕                                │  ← Badge (appears after clicking Add)
│                                            │
│  ┌────────────────────────────┐  ┌─────┐  │
│  │ Paste video URL...         │  │ Add │  │  ← This button!
│  └────────────────────────────┘  └─────┘  │
│                                            │
│  0/5 videos • Supports YouTube...          │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The "Add" button is RIGHT NEXT TO the input box!**

## 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING:

**Problem:** "I pasted URL but don't see badge"
- **Solution:** You forgot to click "Add" button!

**Problem:** "I clicked Share but video didn't appear"
- **Solution:** Badge must appear BEFORE clicking Share Post

**Problem:** "I see the badge but video doesn't play"
- **Solution:** Make sure it's YouTube URL, not Facebook

**Problem:** "Facebook videos don't play inline"
- **Solution:** Facebook videos show "View on Facebook" button (by design)
